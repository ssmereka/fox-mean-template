# Fox JS [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ssmereka/fox-js.png)](http://travis-ci.org/ssmereka/fox-js)


Exactly what you need to get started building a scalable web application using javascript.  Fox-JS is a mixture of boilerplate code and a light framework for creating both the backend and frontend of a web application.  Fox-JS frontend is built on angular-js and the backend using node-js.

## Getting Started

1. Install fox-js

    sudo npm -g install fox

2. Create a new project

    fox new "My Project Name"

3. Start the server and start coding!  No need to restart the server, changes will be live after saving a file.

    fox start

If you need to stop or restart the server simply navigate to the projects root directory and enter:

    fox stop
    fox restart
