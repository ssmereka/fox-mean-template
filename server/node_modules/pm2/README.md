pm2 is a process manager for Node apps with a builtin load-balancer.

## Tech notes

pm2 is perfect when you need to spread your stateless NodeJS code accross all CPUs available on a server, to keep all processes alive forever and to 0s reload them.

# Main features

- Builtin load-balancer (using the native cluster module)
- Script daemonization
- 0s downtime reload for Node
- Startup scripts for Ubuntu/CentOS (use updaterc.d for Ubuntu and chkconfig for others)
- Stop unstable process (avoid infinite loop)
- Monitoring in console
- HTTP API
- [Remote control and real time interface API](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2-interface)

Tested with Node v0.11, v0.10, v0.8 (https://travis-ci.org/Unitech/pm2).
Compatible with CoffeeScript.
Works on Linux & MacOS.

## Different ways to launch a process

```bash
$ pm2 start app.js -i max  # Will start maximum processes depending on available CPUs

$ pm2 start app.js -i 3    # Will start 3 processes

$ pm2 start app.js -x            # Start app.js in fork mode instead of cluster
$ pm2 start app.js -x -- -a 23   # Start app.js in fork mode and pass arguments (-a 23)

$ pm2 start app.js --name serverone # Start a process an name it as server one
                                    # you can now stop the process by doing
                                    # pm2 stop serverone

$ pm2 start app.json                # Start processes with options declared in app.json
                                    # Go to chapter Multi process JSON declaration for more

$ pm2 start app.js -i max -- -a 23  # Pass arguments after -- to app.js

$ pm2 start app.js -i max -e err.log -o out.log  # Will start and generate a configuration file
```

You can also execute app in other languages ([the fork mode](#a23)):
```bash
$ pm2 start my-bash-script.sh -x --interpreter bash

$ pm2 start my-python-script.py -x --interpreter python
```

## Pid file, error and out Log files

By default every logs (error and out), pids files, dump, pm2 logs are located in `~/.pm2/`

```
.pm2/
├── dump.pm2
├── custom_options.sh
├── pm2.log
├── pm2.pid
├── logs
└── pids
```

## 0s downtime reload

This feature permits to reload code without losing in process connections.
Works for apps in cluster_mode (the default mode) that uses sockets (express or other).

```bash
$ pm2 reload all
$ pm2 reload my-api
```

Thanks to TruongSinh Tran-Nguyen https://github.com/truongsinh

### Graceful reload

```bash
$ pm2 gracefulReload all
```

Instead of just processing remaining connections, `gracefulReload` will also send a `shutdown` message to your process, so you can close all database/socket.io/* connections and be sure that your process will properly exit.

```javascript
process.on('message', function(msg) {
  if (msg == 'shutdown') {
    // Your process is going to be reloaded
    // Close all database/socket.io/* connections
    console.log('Closing all connections...');
    setTimeout(function() {
      console.log('Finished closing connections');
      // You can exit to faster the process or it will be
      // automatically killed after 4000ms.
      // You can override the timeout by modifying PM2_GRACEFUL_TIMEOUT
      process.exit(0);
    }, 1500);
  }
});

var http = require('http');

http.createServer(function(req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200);
  res.end('hey');
}).listen(8000, function() {
  console.log('listening');
});
```

## CoffeeScript

```bash
$ pm2 start my_app.coffee
```

That's all !

<a name="a66"/>
## Enabling Harmony ES6

You can enable Harmony ES6 by setting `PM2_NODE_OPTIONS='--harmony'` environment variable option when you start pm2 (pm2 should not be already daemonized).

To pass this option by default, you can edit `~/.pm2/custom_options.sh` and add :

```bash
export PM2_NODE_OPTIONS='--harmony'
```

Then :

```bash
$ pm2 dump
$ pm2 exit
$ pm2 resurrect
```

If ES6 has been enabled you should see this message at the beggining of each pm2 commands :

```
● ES6 mode
```

## Fork mode - execute script in different languages

The default mode of PM2 consists of wrapping the code of your node app into the Node Cluster module. It's called the **cluster mode**.
There is also a more classical way to execute your app, like node-forever does, called the **fork mode**.

In fork mode almost all options are the same as the cluster mode. But no reload, gracefulReload.

**By using the fork mode you will lose core features of PM2 like the automatic clusterization of your code over all CPUs available and the 0s reload.**

So use it if you only need a forever-like behaviour.

Here is how to start your app in fork :

```bash
$ pm2 start app.js -x   # Will start your app.js in fork mode
$ pm2 list              # You will see that on the row "mode" it's written "fork"
```

You can also exec scripts in other languages :

```bash
$ pm2 start my-bash-script.sh -x --interpreter bash

$ pm2 start my-python-script.py -x --interpreter python
```

## Is my production server ready for PM2 ?

Just try the tests before using PM2 on your production server

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Unitech/pm2.git
$ cd pm2
$ npm install  # Or do NODE_ENV=development npm install if some packages are missing
$ npm test
```

If a test is broken please report us issues [here](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2/issues?state=open)
Also make sure you have all dependencies needed. For Ubuntu :

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential
$ wget -qO- https://raw.github.com/creationix/nvm/master/install.sh | sh
$ nvm install v0.11.9
$ nvm use v0.11.9
$ nvm alias default v0.11.9
```

## pm2 list

List infos about all processes managed by pm2. It shows also how many times a process has been restarted because of an unhandled exception.

![Monit](https://github.com/unitech/pm2/raw/master/pres/pm2-list.png)

<a name="a7"/>
## pm2 monit

Monitor CPU and memory usage of every node process (and also clustered processes) managed by pm2.

![Monit](https://github.com/unitech/pm2/raw/master/pres/pm2-monit.png)

<a name="a8"/>
## Startup script generation : pm2 startup

PM2 provides an automatic way to keep Node processes alive on server restart.
On exit it will dump the process list and their environment and will resurrect them on startup.

It uses **System V init script** compatible with **Ubuntu/CentOS/Redhat** (maybe it works on other sys but not 100% sure).

```bash
$ pm2 startup ubuntu # then follow the command instruction
$ pm2 startup centos # will use chkconfig instead of updaterc.d
$ pm2 startup redhat # not very stable for redhat
```

Init script generated are located in /etc/init.d/pm2-init.sh.

### Running script as a different user

The `-u username` option permits to specify which user has to start the process at startup.
**NOTE** that this user must have access to npm, apps and node ! So the best way is to log with this user `su -l www`, then do `pm2 startup -u www`.

Internally it uses `sudo -u $USER`.


<a name="a9"/>
## pm2 logs

Display logs in streaming of all processes, without having to do a tail -f or something else.
You can also pass [name|id] as parameter to stream only the log of a specified process.

## pm2 health web api endpoint

PM2 can disserve an API endpoint to monitor processes and computer health (cpu usage, memory, network interfaces...)

```
pm2 web
```

<a name="a24"/>
## Configuration / Customization

You can edit these options by editing the file `~/.pm2/custom_options.sh`

These variables can be customized :

```
  DAEMON_BIND_HOST   : process.env.PM2_BIND_ADDR || 'localhost',
  DAEMON_RPC_PORT    : process.env.PM2_RPC_PORT  || 6666, // RPC commands
  DAEMON_PUB_PORT    : process.env.PM2_PUB_PORT  || 6667, // Realtime events
  DEBUG              : process.env.PM2_DEBUG || false,
  WEB_INTERFACE      : process.env.PM2_API_PORT  || 9615,
  GRACEFUL_TIMEOUT   : parseInt(process.env.PM2_GRACEFUL_TIMEOUT) || 4000,
  PM2_NODE_OPTIONS   : ''
```

# Multi process JSON declaration

processes.json :

```json
[{
  "name"      : "echo",
  "script"    : "./examples/args.js",
  "args"      : "['--toto=heya coco', '-d', '1']",
  "env": {
      "NODE_ENV": "production",
      "AWESOME_SERVICE_API_TOKEN": "xxx"
  }
}
,{
    "name"       : "api",
    "script"     : "./examples/child.js",
    "instances"  : "4",
    "error_file" : "./examples/child-err.log",
    "out_file"   : "./examples/child-out.log",
    "pid_file"   : "./examples/child.pid",
    "exec_mode"  : "cluster_mode",
    "port"       : 9005
},{
  "min_uptime" : "100",
  "name" : "auto-kill",
  "exec_mode" : "fork_mode",
  "script" : "./examples/killfast.js"
}]
```

Then with the cli :
```bash
$ pm2 start processes.json
$ pm2 stop processes.json
$ pm2 delete processes.json
$ pm2 restart processes.json
```

<a name="a27"/>
# Contributing/Development mode

Fork PM2 and to hack it it's pretty simple :

```bash
$ pm2 kill   # kill the current pm2
$ git clone my_pm2_fork.git
$ cd pm2/
$ DEBUG=* PM2_DEBUG=true./bin/pm2 start xxx.js
```

Everytime you do a modification on the code you have to restart pm2, so just do a `./bin/pm2 kill` before
starting an app or something else.
You have to restart it because the code is daemonized on the memory.

## Install pm2 development

```bash
$ npm install git://github.com/Unitech/pm2#development -g
```

# MISC Notes

- Remove init script : `sudo update-rc.d -f pm2-init.sh remove`


<a name="a21"/>
# Known bugs and workarounds

First, install the lastest pm2 version :

```bash
$ npm install -g pm2@latest
```

- Node 0.10.x doesn't free script port when stopped. It's due to the NodeJS cluster module.
So if you feel that this problem is important for your use case, use the fork mode the [fork mode](#a23) instead.
By using the fork mode you will lose core features of PM2 like the automatic clusterization of your code over all CPUs available and the 0s reload.

```
$ pm2 start index.js -x  # start my app in fork mode
```

For more informations about this issue : [#74](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2/issues/74)

- `Cannot read property 'getsockname' of undefined`

When using the cluster mode (by default) you can't use ports from 0 to 1024. If you really need to exec in this range use the [fork mode](#a23) with the `-x` parameter.
By using the fork mode you will lose core features of PM2 like the automatic clusterization of your code over all CPUs available and the 0s reload.
